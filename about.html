				<p class="container_title"> About this site</p>
				<p>This website is a part of <a href="https://theodinproject.com">The Odin Project (TOP)</a> journey to learn web devlopment and is the first project of the Foundation course. It focus on learning basics and some best practices for html and css while getting a grasp of how static webpage works.</p>

				<p class="container_title"> My vision and inspirations. </p>
				<p>Here the goal isn't to create a fancy website ready to use with alot of content and interaction. I personally decided to focus on creating a basic webpage trying to produce a modern flat design. 
					My main inspiration is <a href="https://allrecipes.com">Allrecipes.com</a> website and I tried to look at other cooking page such as <a href="https://marmiton.org">marmiton.org</a> and <a href="https://recipetineats.com">recipetineats.com</a>
				This page has actually no color palette and I decided to start only with some shade white and some shade of grey.
				/!\ it is not responsive, I will update the project while learning more until I feel I can't add more css and js.
				</p>

				<p class="container_title"> About me </p>
				<p>I'm a 27 years old french guy, I'm a data analyst and want to practice and improve as a web developer, hoping that I will be able to land a job in this field in the future. I have some knowledge about web development but I felt I was lacking on fundamentals knowledge and practice. That's why I decided to start TOP, my goal is to produce as much things as possible to gain confidence and explore as much as possible the web development field.</p>

				<p>You can find my other project on my <a href="https://github.com/raaynbo">Github</a> or even follow me on my social media.</p>
